# Halide

A dark, quiet [Masthead](https://github.com/JoeriDijkstra/masthead) theme for
photographers. Named after the silver halide crystals that make film work.

The point of the theme is the **Gallery** page: a photography category you fill
in from the page editor — a kicker, an intro, and a repeatable list of photos.
It renders as a masonry grid with a click-to-enlarge lightbox that is pure CSS
(`:target`), so there is no JavaScript in the theme at all.

## Adding a gallery

In the admin: **New page → Theme page → Gallery**. Then fill in:

| Field | What it does |
|---|---|
| Kicker | Small label above the title — `Portraits`, `Iceland, 2024` |
| Intro | A short paragraph under the title. Empty = skipped |
| Columns | Columns on desktop. Drops to 2 on tablet, 1 on phone |
| Show photo count | The `6 PHOTOGRAPHS` line |
| Image corners | Rounding for every photo on the page: off / small / medium / large |
| Photos | Add / remove / drag-reorder rows: image, caption, alt text |

Each photo row takes an uploaded image, an optional caption (shown under the
thumbnail and in the enlarged view), and alt text (falls back to the caption).
Rows with no image are skipped, so a half-filled row won't break the grid.

Make one page per category — `Portraits`, `Landscapes`, `Weddings` — and they
show up in the site nav automatically.

## The home page

**New page → Theme page → Home**, then set it as the site homepage. Four
sections, each with its own on/off switch, so you can run the whole thing or
just a hero:

| Section | Contains |
|---|---|
| Hero | Wide image, title, tagline, and an optional button |
| Featured galleries | A repeatable list of cover image + title + kicker + link |
| Statement | A short about paragraph with an optional portrait beside it |
| Journal | The latest N posts, with N up to you |

Sections you switch off render nothing at all — no empty headings, no gaps. The
same **Image corners** dropdown applies here.

## Tokens

`bg`, `fg`, `accent` and `max` (content width) drive the whole palette; the
muted, rule and sunken tones are derived from them with `color-mix`, so
changing the background keeps the theme coherent. `favicon` and the two post
toggles (`show_search`, `show_tags`) work as in any Masthead theme.

## Local preview

```bash
masthead preview        # http://localhost:4010
masthead validate
masthead package
```

`preview/pages/` holds sample content — a home page, a `Dunes` gallery, an
about page and a journal — so the preview shows the theme with real
photographs in it. It is preview-only and is not part of the packaged zip.

The rest of this file is the standard Masthead theme reference.

## Layout

```
manifest.json              required — theme metadata + customizable tokens
theme.css                  required — the stylesheet inlined into <style>
templates/
  layout.liquid            required — wraps every render target
  index.liquid             required — site homepage (post list)
  post.liquid              required — single blog post
  page.liquid              required — standalone page (markdown / html body)
  not_found.liquid         required — site-scoped 404
  pages/                   optional — theme pages (see below)
    blog.liquid            a theme page template
    blog.json              its settings config (sidecar)
    gallery.liquid         the photography category page
    gallery.json           its settings config (sidecar)
    home.liquid            the portfolio front page
    home.json              its settings config (sidecar)
assets/                    optional — images, fonts, additional CSS/JS
preview/                   optional — local sample content for `masthead preview`
```

Every file listed as `required` must be present in the zip Masthead
extracts, or the upload will fail validation. **`blog` is no longer a
required fixed template** — the post-list page now ships as a *theme page*
under `templates/pages/`, and you're free to delete it or add your own.

## The manifest

`manifest.json` declares the theme's identity and two kinds of site-wide
customization surface: **tokens** (knobs that apply to the whole site) and
**metadata** (default per-page settings for ordinary markdown/html pages).

```json
{
  "name": "Default",
  "slug": "my-theme",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Masthead",
  "description": "Minimal, readable, opinionated about typography.",
  "tokens": [
    { "key": "accent", "label": "Accent color", "type": "color",
      "default": "#0066cc", "category": "Appearance" },
    { "key": "favicon", "label": "Favicon", "type": "file",
      "default": "", "category": "Appearance" },
    { "key": "show_search", "label": "Show post search", "type": "boolean",
      "default": false, "category": "Posts" }
  ],
  "metadata": [
    { "key": "layout", "label": "Page layout", "type": "select",
      "options": ["contained", "wide"], "default": "contained" },
    { "key": "show_navigation", "label": "Show site navigation",
      "type": "boolean", "default": true }
  ]
}
```

- `slug` is the unique identifier. It must be 1–32 chars; lowercase
  letters, digits, and hyphens; and must start and end with a letter or
  digit. The slugs `default`, `studio`, and `tailwind` are reserved for
  built-ins — pick something else.
- `version` uses semver. Re-uploading a theme **updates it in place only
  when the manifest version is a strictly-newer SemVer** than the
  installed copy; otherwise the upload is rejected. Bump it whenever you
  ship a change you want existing sites to pick up.

### Tokens (site-wide)

`tokens` declares knobs that show up on each site's **Settings** screen.
Most tokens become CSS custom properties; the `file` type resolves to an
uploaded asset. Tokens are always **scalar** — they can't hold nested
objects or lists.

To expose a new customizable value, add a token here **and** use it in
`theme.css` as `var(--my-key)`. Masthead emits the effective tokens as CSS
custom properties at render time, *after* `theme.css`, so any
`var(--accent)` reference picks up the overridden value:

```css
:root { --accent: <user value or default>; }
```

**`file` tokens in CSS.** A `file` token is emitted as a CSS `url(...)`,
so reference it with `var()` where a URL is expected
(`background-image: var(--hero)`). An empty `file` token (no upload
chosen) resolves to an empty string, so guard with a sensible default or
let the rule no-op.

**Categories.** `tokens[].category` (optional) groups the token under a
labelled accordion on the Settings screen. Tokens with no category fall
under **"General"**. Use categories (`"Appearance"`, `"Typography"`,
`"Posts"`, …) to keep a large token set navigable.

See **Field types** below for the full list of scalar types.

### Metadata (per-page defaults for ordinary pages)

`metadata` declares per-page settings for **markdown / html pages** — the
fields show up on the page editor's **"Page settings"** section. The
active theme drives the form: every field you declare becomes an input the
user fills in per page, and the values reach your templates as
`page.metadata.<key>`.

Unlike tokens, top-level metadata fields may be **containers** (`object`
and `list`), so a single page can carry structured settings. See **Field
types** below.

```liquid
<article{% if page.metadata.layout == "wide" %} class="wide"{% endif %}>
  {{ body_html }}
</article>
```

**Theme-switch resilience.** Unknown metadata keys are *preserved* on
save — a page authored under theme A and edited under theme B keeps A's
keys even though the form doesn't show them, so switching back to A
restores everything. Tokens behave differently: unknown overrides are
dropped, because tokens are inert without a matching CSS variable.

**Type coercion.** Form posts always arrive as strings; the renderer
coerces declared fields to their type before the template sees them. You
can branch directly on `{% if page.metadata.show_navigation %}` without
the `"true"` / `"false"` footgun.

**Empty values fall back to defaults.** Blanking an input on save strips
that key, so the next render reads the manifest default again.

## Theme pages

A **theme page** is a full-page template you ship with the theme, used for
pages whose content is *structured settings* rather than a freeform
markdown/html body. The post list (`blog`), a landing page, a contact
page, a pricing table — anything where the author fills in fields instead
of writing prose.

A theme page is two files in `templates/pages/`:

```
templates/pages/landing.liquid   the Liquid template
templates/pages/landing.json     its settings config (the "sidecar")
```

The basename ties them together (`landing.liquid` ↔ `landing.json`). The
`.liquid` file renders the page; the `.json` file declares the editable
settings. A `.liquid` with no matching `.json` is a theme page with no
settings.

### The sidecar config

```json
{
  "label": "Landing",
  "description": "A marketing landing page with a hero and feature grid.",
  "metadata": [
    { "key": "headline", "label": "Headline", "type": "string",
      "default": "Welcome" }
  ]
}
```

- `label` — the human name shown in the page editor's template dropdown
  (falls back to the filename).
- `description` — optional helper text shown under the dropdown.
- `metadata` — the field schema for this page, identical in shape to the
  manifest's `metadata` (see **Field types**). Values reach the template
  as `page.metadata.<key>`.

There is **no `version`** in a sidecar — page configs travel with the
theme and are versioned by the manifest.

### Authoring flow in the admin

In the page editor, the author picks the **Theme page** format, then
chooses one of your theme pages from a dropdown. The page's "settings"
form is built from that page's sidecar `metadata`; there is no body
editor. **The template can't be changed once the page has been saved** —
pick the right one up front. (Switching a *new*, unsaved page between
templates is fine.)

`blog` ships as a theme page in this template: set a page's format to
**Theme page → Blog**, and optionally make it the site homepage, to get
the post list as your front page.

## Field types

Tokens, manifest `metadata`, and theme-page sidecar `metadata` all share
one field model. **Scalar** types are allowed everywhere; **container**
types (`object`, `list`) are allowed only at the *top level* of a
`metadata` schema (manifest or sidecar), never in tokens and never nested
inside another container (one level of nesting only).

### Scalar types

| Type | Editor | Template sees |
|---|---|---|
| `string` | single-line text | the string |
| `text` | multi-line textarea | the string |
| `color` | color picker | `#rrggbb` |
| `length` | text input | CSS length (`880px`, `60ch`) |
| `number` | numeric input | a number (`123`, `1.5`) |
| `url` | text input (URL-validated) | the string |
| `boolean` | checkbox | `true` / `false` |
| `select` | dropdown over `options` | the chosen option string |
| `file` | picker over the site's uploads | a **public URL** (resolved from the stored upload id at render time) |

- `default` is **required for every scalar field** and is used when there
  is no override.
- `options` is **required for `select`** — a non-empty array of strings.
- `description` (optional) renders as helper text under the input.
- `category` (optional) groups the field under a labelled accordion in the
  editor, exactly like token categories.

### `object` — a named group

A group of scalar fields with a single value (a map). Use it to bundle
related settings, e.g. a hero block.

```json
{ "key": "hero", "label": "Hero", "type": "object",
  "fields": [
    { "key": "title", "label": "Title", "type": "string", "default": "Welcome" },
    { "key": "image", "label": "Background", "type": "file", "default": "" }
  ]
}
```

```liquid
<section style="background-image: url({{ page.metadata.hero.image }})">
  <h1>{{ page.metadata.hero.title | escape }}</h1>
</section>
```

- `fields` (required, non-empty) holds the nested **scalar** fields.
- An object's default is derived from its fields' defaults — you don't
  give the object itself a `default`.

### `list` — a repeatable group

A repeatable group whose value is an **array of maps**. The author can
**add, remove, and drag-reorder** items in the editor.

```json
{ "key": "features", "label": "Features", "type": "list",
  "item_label": "Feature",
  "fields": [
    { "key": "title", "label": "Title", "type": "string", "default": "" },
    { "key": "icon",  "label": "Icon",  "type": "file",   "default": "" }
  ],
  "default": [
    { "title": "Fast" },
    { "title": "Simple" }
  ]
}
```

```liquid
<ul class="features">
  {% for f in page.metadata.features %}
    <li>
      {% if f.icon != "" %}<img src="{{ f.icon }}" alt="">{% endif %}
      {{ f.title | escape }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

- `fields` (required, non-empty) holds the nested **scalar** fields each
  item carries.
- `item_label` (optional) names a single row in the editor (the "Add
  <item_label>" button, row headings).
- `default` (optional) is an array of seed items, rendered and editable
  out of the box; omit it (or use `[]`) to start empty.
- `file` fields inside list items resolve to public URLs just like
  top-level file fields.

## Templates

Templates are [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) — the safe,
sandboxed templating language used by Jekyll and Shopify. They have **no
access** to Elixir, the filesystem, or the database — the rendering
context is a fixed set of plain maps.

### Render flow

1. The inner template (e.g. `post.liquid`, or a `pages/<name>.liquid`)
   renders against the page's context.
2. The result is passed to `layout.liquid` as the variable `content`.
3. The final HTML is sent to the browser.

### Variables available

| Variable | layout | index | post | page | theme page | not_found |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `site` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `pages` (nav list) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `theme.tokens.<key>` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `theme.css` / `content` | ✓ | | | | | |
| `posts` | | ✓ | | | ✓ | |
| `post` | | | ✓ | | | |
| `page` | | | | ✓ | ✓ | |
| `page.metadata.<key>` | | | | ✓ | ✓ | |
| `page.template` | | | | | ✓ | |
| `body_html` | | | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| `tags` / `current_tag` | | | | | ✓ (blog) | |

Each shape:

```
site     { name, title, description, slug, css_overrides, homepage_slug }
post     { title, slug, excerpt, published_at, url }
page     { title, slug, format, template, url, metadata }
```

- `site.homepage_slug` is the slug of the page chosen as the homepage
  (empty when the homepage is the default post list) — handy for marking
  the active nav item.
- `page.template` is the theme-page name (e.g. `"blog"`) for theme pages,
  empty otherwise.
- `page.metadata` is the merge of the schema defaults (manifest `metadata`
  for ordinary pages, the sidecar `metadata` for theme pages) and whatever
  the author filled in.
- Theme pages receive the full `posts` list, so a `blog` page can render
  it. On a blog theme page, `tags` lists the site's tags and `current_tag`
  reflects the `?tag=` filter, so you can build a tag filter (each `tag`
  has `name`, `slug`, `active`).
- `body_html` arrives **pre-sanitized** by Masthead's HTML allowlist — the
  one variable that intentionally emits raw HTML. Theme pages have no body
  editor, so they don't get `body_html` (the `blog` page guards for it).

### Escaping user-supplied strings

Liquid does **not** auto-escape output. Any string a site owner can edit
(site name, page title, post title, a metadata `string`/`text` field, …)
must be piped through `escape`:

```liquid
<h1>{{ site.title | default: site.name | escape }}</h1>
```

This is the single most important footgun to remember when authoring a
theme. If you forget, a value like `<script>alert(1)</script>` will
execute in every visitor's browser. (`file` fields are URLs, not free
text, so they don't need escaping — but never interpolate one into a
`javascript:`-capable context.)

### Filters

Masthead ships the standard Liquid filter set (`escape`, `default`, `date`,
`size`, …) plus three additions:

| Filter | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `strftime` | Calendar-style date formatting on `DateTime` values | `{{ post.published_at | strftime: "%B %-d, %Y" }}` |
| `iso8601` | Safe-on-nil ISO-8601 for `<time datetime="...">` | `<time datetime="{{ post.published_at | iso8601 }}">` |
| `asset_url` | Build a URL to a theme-bundled asset | `<img src="{{ 'logo.png' | asset_url: theme.asset_base }}">` |

## Previewing locally (recommended)

The [`masthead` CLI](https://github.com/JoeriDijkstra/masthead-cli) renders
your theme through the exact same pipeline as the live platform — no
database, no upload step:

```bash
masthead preview            # serves http://localhost:4010, re-reads on refresh
masthead validate           # parse manifest + templates + page configs
masthead package            # build an installable zip
```

`preview` ships realistic sample content and a live token inspector, so
you can iterate on templates, `theme.css`, and page settings and see the
result on refresh.

## Packaging and uploading

The zip Masthead consumes is exactly:

```
manifest.json
theme.css
templates/layout.liquid  index.liquid  post.liquid  page.liquid  not_found.liquid
templates/pages/*.liquid + *.json     (theme pages + their sidecar configs)
assets/…                              (optional)
```

Build it with the CLI (`masthead package`) or by hand:

```bash
zip -r my-theme.zip manifest.json theme.css templates assets
```

Then in the Masthead admin: **Themes → + Upload theme**, drop the zip in
the modal, click Install. The validator checks size caps, path safety, the
manifest schema, every Liquid template, **and every page sidecar config**
before promoting the files into object storage. Once installed, the theme
shows up in the **Theme** dropdown on each site's settings page.

## Customizing — a typical workflow

1. Set a non-reserved `slug` in `manifest.json`.
2. Bump `version` whenever you ship a meaningful change.
3. Edit `theme.css` — the cascade is `theme.css` first, then your token
   overrides, then the site's free-text CSS overrides.
4. Edit the templates. Always `| escape` user-supplied strings.
5. Add or remove tokens / metadata fields, grouping them with `category`.
   The settings UI and page editor rebuild their forms from the manifest
   and sidecars, so every declared field automatically gets an input.
6. Add theme pages under `templates/pages/` (a `.liquid` + a `.json`) for
   structured, settings-driven pages like landings or the post list.

## Limits

- Archive: max **5 MB** compressed, **25 MB** uncompressed, **200 files**.
- Asset extensions allowed: `.css .png .jpg .jpeg .gif .webp .svg .woff .woff2 .ttf .otf .ico .json`.
- Per-site CSS overrides: max **50 KB**.
- No `..` / absolute paths / Windows-style separators in zip entries.
- Container fields nest **one level** (objects/lists hold scalars only).
- Partials (`{% include %}`, `{% render %}`) are not supported in v1.
